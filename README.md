### Overview of the analysis

#### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
#### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk 

#### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk


### Naive Random Oversampling

1. Balanced Accuracy: 0.6612700484668286
2. Precision: The precision is low for High-risk loans and is high for Low-risk loans.
3. Recall: High/Low risk = .66/.67

### SMOTE Oversampling

1. Balanced Accuracy: 0.6303296388959394
2. Precision: The precision is low for High-risk loans and is high for Low-risk loans.
3. Recall: High/Low risk = .62/.64

### Undersampling
